        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
        I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. 
        It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
        "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . ."
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so
deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that
shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." And I felt him to be
more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished
by a little puff of wind . . .
